# Additional dependencies for Quick Actions (Production Ready)
# These should be added to your main requirements.txt

# Email and CSV handling (likely already present)
# fastapi
# pymongo
# motor  # for async MongoDB

# Async operations
asyncio  # Built into Python 3.7+

# Logging (built into Python)
# logging

# Production monitoring alternatives (optional, pick one):
# psutil==5.9.6  # Only if deploying on VPS/dedicated servers
# sentry-sdk==1.38.0  # For error tracking in production
# prometheus-client==0.19.0  # For metrics collection

# Note: 
# - psutil was REMOVED from the quick actions to ensure cloud compatibility
# - The health check now uses platform module (built-in) instead
# - All file operations use in-memory StringIO instead of disk writes
